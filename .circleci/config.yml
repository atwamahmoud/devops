# Orbs are reusable packages of CircleCI configuration that you may share across projects, enabling you to create encapsulated, parameterized commands, jobs, and executors that can be used across multiple projects.
# # See: https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/orb-intro/
# orbs:
#   node: circleci/node@5.0.0
#   # The S3 orb will setup the aws-cli and quickly copy or sync anything to s3.
#   # Orbs reduce the amount of configuration required for common tasks.
#   # See the orb documentation here: https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-s3
#   # NOTE: Environment variables containing the necessary secrets can be setup in the CircleCI UI
